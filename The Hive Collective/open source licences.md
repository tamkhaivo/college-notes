Title: From Code to Community - The Case for Open Source Licencing in Startup Strategy

## Copyright

- Automatically granted upon creation
- No Registration or notice required
- You inherently receive copyright protection
- Motivation is to foster innovation
- Duration --> Life + 70 vs 95 if "work for hire"
- MT32 - ROMs were copied - Roland says we cannot copy ==> Sewing --> Copyriting must be in the ROM itself

- Copyright header and declaring the authors and date
- Registration required for attorney or statutory damages
- Fees associated with Registration

### What can be copywrited?

1. Original Expression

- Photograph

2. Minimal Creativity

- Small amount of creative effort is required
- You canot copyyright a single for next loop

3. Fixed in a Tangible Medium

- Must be written, recorded or otherwise captured in a physical or digital form

#### Example

- Picture Expression
- Schematic Expression
- Details of circuits not protected -- Not protected unless patentented

## Patents

- $5000 that fires million dollar bullets
- Trade Secrets > Patents from protecting IP

## Licences Matters

- If you dont choose a licence, then most restrictive copyright applies

## Introduction to Open Source (Open Source Initiative or OSI)

Therefore an opensource grants rights to the user -- permissions that would be otherwide prohibited by default under copyright law.

- **What is Open Source?**
  - Software with source code that is made available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute.
  - Promotes collaboration, transparency, and community-driven development.
- **Why Use Open Source?**
  - Cost-effective (often free).
  - Flexibility and customization.
  - Community support and collaboration.
  - Transparency and security (peer review).
  - Innovation and rapid development.

## Types of Open Source Licenses

- **Permissive Licenses**
  - Minimal restrictions on how the software can be used, modified, and distributed.
  - Often allow for commercial use and closed-source derivatives.
  - Examples:
    - **MIT License:** Very simple and permissive. Users can do almost anything with the code as long as they include the original copyright and license notice.
    - **BSD Licenses:** Similar to MIT, but with slight variations like prevention using contributor names in promotion.
    - **Apache License 2.0:** Allows for patent use and commercial use. Requires attribution and a copy of the license and requires notive of changes. Adds EXPLICIT patent grant, cannot sue. Contrivutors licences any relevant patents to users of the software w/ business friendly language. Requires preservation of copyright, licences, and Notice file.
      Modification has to be marked.
      Can relicence your own changes.
      Broad use without legal ambituity
- **Copyleft Licenses**

  - Require that derivative works also be open source under the same license.
  - "Viral" nature: any modifications or distributions must also be open source.
  - Reciprical Licences
  - Examples:
    - **GNU General Public License (GPL):** The most common copyleft license. Requires that any derivative work be licensed under GPL.
    - **GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL):** A more permissive version of GPL, allowing linking with non-GPL code in some cases.
    - **AGPL:** Requires sharing source when software is run over a network

- Richard Stallman (GPL GNU) -
- GPL strong copyleft - if you modify GPL then must share changes under same licences
- Core goal is to keep software free for all users by ensuring that improces and stay open
- Allows Commercial use without relicnes under more restctives licences - does not apply to hosted services

GPLv3 - Updated 2007 to address modern concerns like Tivoization, patent retalation, or better interional licences compaitliy.

LGPLv3 - Weaker copyleft licences that allow proprietary software to link to opensource library without requiring the full applicatin to GPL.

AGPLv3 - Extends GPLV3 to networked software, reuqiring source dode disclosure when software is only accessed over a network.

## Risk Contradiction

1. Too Permissive - Others Might Profit without Giving Back
2. Too Restrictive - Limit Adoption, collaberation or Impact
3. Which Risk you are more willing to live with?

- **Other Licenses**
  - **Creative Commons:** Primarily for creative works (images, text, music), but some licenses can be applied to software.
  - **Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL):** A hybrid license that is copyleft for modified files but permissive for other files.

## Key Considerations When Choosing a License

- **Commercial Use:** Will the software be used commercially?
- **Derivative Works:** Do you want to allow closed-source derivatives?
- **Patent Rights:** Does the license address patent rights?
- **Attribution:** What level of attribution is required?
- **Compatibility:** Is the

## The business case

### Strategic Advantages

- Reduces Development and Distribution Costs
- Build Credibility with Developers, Instituions, and Investors
  --- Cultural Development Experiences for UI and UX
- An Open Source Encourages external contribution and rapid feedback loops

### Dual Licensing

--- B2B Crediablity then

- Combines open-source access with a commercial license for Revenue.
- Examples GitLab, MySQL, Qt
- Allows Monetization while keeping core code open

### Challenges

- Ensuring Licences Compliances (Internally and with Contributors)
- Protecting Proprietary components in hybrid models
- Managing expectations vetween open community and paying customers

### Monitizatoin Strats

- Open Core -
- Suppory & services - Revenue and Training
- SaaS - Added value infrastructure

#### Case Study

- Red Hat - Enterprise Subscriotion
- iXsystems / TrueNAS (Acquired FreeNAS stewardship in 2009)
- TrueNAS CORE and TrueNAS Enterprise into commercially supported storage platform
- Jitsi - SIP communicator, VOIP to video conferencing tool -- AQURIRED BY ATLASSIAN then 8x8
- Canvas - 2 grad stuents 2008, LMS were outdated and difficult to use, lacked modern web technologies
- Early Funding
- Early Decision - Open Source Software to gain traction and build trust - AGLPv3 (improvements but give back to project)
- 8 million venture capital - reducing IT overhead for instituation
  -- Email is integrated within services
- GitLab - 2011 Dmitriy - Alternative to Github then to DevOps Platform --> Offered under an MIT Licences initially then GPLv3 licences - Customers are technical users and concerned about adoption
  -- Community Edition (CE) - Open GPLv3
  -- Enterprise Edition (EE)

### Strategies

1. Initalized MIT versions (Iterating and Eyeballs, and People to Use the Product)
2. Later Closed Source or AGLPv3 for further iterations

User Stories - Translate Problems into Stories
-- Users can read them and they can understand them
-- "addresses the frustrations with legacy systems making adoption easier"
