**Contributor License Agreement**
**For The Hive Collective at California State University, Sacramento**

**Preamble**

This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into by and between The Hive Collective at California State University, Sacramento ("Organization") and you, the Contributor ("Contributor"), regarding your contribution of original works of authorship to projects of the Organization.

**Agreement**

**1. Definitions**

For the purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions shall apply:

*   "**Agreement**" means this Contributor License Agreement.
*   "**Organization**" means The Hive Collective at California State University, Sacramento.
*   "**Project**" means any project, software, application, creative work, or initiative developed, managed, or undertaken by the Organization.
*   "**Contribution**" means any original work of authorship, including but not limited to code, documentation, designs, writings, ideas, suggestions, or other materials, that is intentionally submitted by Contributor to the Organization for inclusion in a Project.
*   "**Contributor**" means the individual or legal entity executing this Agreement.
*   "**Intellectual Property Rights**" means all patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all renewals and extensions thereof, regardless of whether such rights arise under the laws of any state, country or jurisdiction.

**2. Grant of License**

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Contributor hereby grants to the Organization a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, and sub-licensable license to:

*   Use, reproduce, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Contribution and derivative works thereof, in source and/or object form, in, on, or in connection with the Project and any related projects.
*   Use, and authorize others to use, Contributor’s name, likeness, and biographical information in connection with the Contribution and the distribution and marketing thereof.

This license is granted for any purpose related to the Organization’s Projects, including but not limited to research, development, testing, modification, distribution, and commercial purposes.

**3. Contributor Representations and Warranties**

Contributor represents and warrants that:

*   The Contribution is Contributor’s own original work of authorship.
*   Contributor has the full right, power, and authority to grant the licenses granted herein.
*   The Contribution does not violate or infringe upon the Intellectual Property Rights, privacy rights, or any other rights of any third party.
*   The Contribution does not contain any viruses, worms, Trojan horses, or other malicious code.
*   To the extent Contributor provides any personal information to the Organization, such information is accurate and current.

**4. Intellectual Property Ownership**

Contributor acknowledges and agrees that, as between Contributor and the Organization, Contributor retains all copyright and other Intellectual Property Rights in and to the original Contribution. However, Contributor understands and agrees that by submitting the Contribution, the Organization and its successors and assigns will own all Intellectual Property Rights in and to the Project as a compilation or collective work incorporating the Contribution, and in any derivative works of the Project.

**5. Royalties (Optional and Example)**

Unless otherwise agreed in a separate written agreement, the license granted herein is royalty-free.  The Organization reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to establish a royalty structure for Projects in the future. Examples of possible royalty models include:

*   A percentage of revenue generated directly from the Project.
*   A fixed royalty fee per Project or per Contribution.
*   A tiered royalty system based on Project success metrics or levels of Contribution.

Any implementation of royalties will be subject to a separate written agreement between the Organization and Contributors at that time. This Agreement, in its current form, does not guarantee any royalties to the Contributor.

**6. Moral Rights**

Contributor acknowledges that applicable law may provide Contributor with certain inalienable moral rights in the Contribution. To the fullest extent permitted by such law, Contributor hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert any such moral rights with respect to the Contribution, and consents to any action of the Organization that would otherwise violate such moral rights.  To the extent moral rights cannot be waived, Contributor agrees not to assert them against the Organization or its licensees.  The Organization may choose to provide attribution for the Contribution as a matter of courtesy and best practice, but is not legally obligated to do so.

**7. Governing Law**

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.

**8. Entire Agreement**

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Contribution and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between the parties with respect to such subject matter. No modification or amendment of this Agreement will be effective unless in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both parties.

**IN WITNESS WHEREOF**, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date of submission of the Contribution.
