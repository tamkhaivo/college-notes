# CSC 163. Parallel Programming with GPUs

## CPU - Lanthency Oriented

1. Branch Predictions
2. Multi-core trajectory (Lanthency Hiding)
3. Out of Order Processing (Lanthency Hiding)

## GPU - Throughput Oriented

1. Small Cache
2. No Branch Prediction
3. No Dataforwarding
4. Energy Efficent
5. Multi-threaded trajectory

Warp - 32 threads - Same Line of Code - Same Time
Block - Group of Warps to each streaming processes - not completed the same time
Grid - Launch Kernal - that initalize Blocks to SMS

### GPU Tasks

1. Financial Analysis
2. Scientific Simulation
3. Digital Audio Processing
4. Interactice Physics
5. Computer Vision

- Regular Computational Patterns
- Computational Complexcity - Large Overhead --> Slower
- Memory Bound Tasks
- Mathematical recurrances

#### Optimization Techniques

- No branch divergances
- Portablity (Applications runs hardware agnostic)
- Scalability (Increase HW Availablity = Increased Efficency)

#### Appilcations

1. Libraries (Thrust, Linear Algebra)

- Easy to use
- High Performance

2. Compiler Directives (OpenACC) --> Assert help from compiler

- Easy to use
- Portable Code

3. Programming Languages (CUDA, OpenCL)

- Most Performance
- Most Flexiblity

#### 2012 Imagenet challence competition

- CNN for image detection
- Deeplearning
- Inference (Asking it Questions)
- Scan Operation -> Powerful Parallel Pattern (Parallel Sort)

## Hybrid Task Assignments

- CPU sequential
- GPU parallel

GP (General Purpose) GPU - OpenCL (CUDA)
OpenCL - Primative - Lower Level
CUDA - Easier Higher Level
