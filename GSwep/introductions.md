# Introductions and First Meeting Agenda

## Introduction

I am a college student pursing a Computer Science Degree.
I am somewhat of a performance junkie and for physical activities I like bouldering.

- Why do you want to pursue this program?
  -- I am pursuing this program because I want to hone my problem solving skills and recognizing where I am at.
- Why did your mentor join?
  -- ???
- What do you want to accomplish in the next 10 weeks?
  -- I want to be more familiar with how to use more problem solving tecnhiques than the basic Array, List, Tree, Pointers, and Manipulations Strings.
- What are your goals post grad?
  -- Post Grad I want to start a business that will revolutionize banking.
- Go over your CodeSignal assessment together

- Review what you understood, how you felt, what was hard
  -- I understood creating if statements and for loops, I have yet to master the functional paradime
- Agree to a weekly meeting cadence that you can both adhere to until end of May (have your SWE update your calendar invite accordingly)

- Create a weekly action plan to enhance foundational coding and problem-solving skills in key areas that complement your learning.

- For students who are applying to internships/ jobs, let your SWE know so you can build in time to interview prep when needed.

## Design Interviews

1. Analyze Problem
2. Discuss Solutions
3. Weigh Pros and Cons
4. Communicate

### Framework

1. Define the problem space (Shrink with system constraints)
2. Functional and non-functional requirements
3. Scratch vs Existing Peieces
4. Business Objectives and User Experience
5. Estimate Data
   -- Storage size and bandwith requirements
   -- Assumptions w/ user volume

6. High Level Design

- APIs, rest, soap, rpc, graphql w/ WHY
- request parameters and response type

3. Deep Dive into Design

- Nonfuncting requirements impact design choices
- FRESH Data - speed up data and data ingestion queries
  -- Large Data - Data Partitioning to balance traffic
  -- Load balanceing layer -

4. Identify Bottlenecks and Scaling

- Single Point of Failure
- Replication of Data - Horizontal Sharding
- Global Service - CDN
- Edge Cases - Peaktime Usage
- 10x more users?

5. Review and wrapup!

- List major considerations
- satisfies all requirements
- directions for further improvements
