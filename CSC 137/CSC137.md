## Important - Most Time

1. CPU (DESIGN AND BUILD CPU)

- conventional (positivde to negative)
- Combinations -> Binary States
- All circuits are connected to volts & ground
  -- vcc (voltage) = cdd (drain)
  -- inverter = NOT can be added to the regular circuits to make them NAND, NOR, NXOR
  -- cononical ordering = truth tables
  -- XOR = AB' + A'B

3. GPU
4. Tensor Processing Unit (Specialized Math Chip)

## Data Representation

## Digital Design

### Combinational Design (No Memory States)

1. Capture

- Truth table or equation whichever describes **desired behavior**

2. Convert

- Truth Table instead of equations -- create an equation for each output then SIMPLIFY KMAPS --> Column Simplfiction
- Minimze number of chips - Minimize number of gates - CMOS 4000 - Dual inline packages (DIP 14)

3. Implement

- For each output create a circuit corresponding to the output equations

Output in binary, on 2 outputs y and z, the number of 1s on 3 binary inputs a,b,c

- Adding 3 single binary numbers --> Voting System
- A'B'C + A'C'B + B'C'A + ABC (Midterm) = y
- ABC' + AC'B + BCA' + ABC (Midterm) = z

{ABC} == Term
A, B, C == Factors

==> Max numbers of inverters I need? (len of input)
==> Max Number of AND gates = Count of 1s in output on truth table (Unless shared & No timing issues aka glitches)

#### Example

F = A'BC + AB'C + ABC' + ABC + ABC + ABC
==> BC(A' + A) + AC(B' + B) + AB(C' + C)
==> BC + AC + AB

- Removing Glitches
- Removing Delays
- Simplier Circuit
- Unsyncronized

### Sequential Design

- setup time constraint
- hold time constraint
- Propegation delay
- Contamindation delay

#### Contamination Delay

- Time for Output doesnt change between Input Changes
- Current State starts to change
- Time after clock edge that might be unstable

1. For Sequential Circuit such as 2 D-flip flops connected in series
2. The contamination delay of the first flip flip must be factored in to avoid violating the hold-time constraint of the second flip-flop receiving the output from the first flip flop
3. Here the contaminsation delay is the amount of time needed for a change in the flipflip clock input to result in the initial change at the flipflop output q
4. If there is insufficicent delay from the output of the first flip-flop to the input of the second, the input may change before the hold has passed.
5. Because the second flopflop is still unstable its data would then be contaminsated

##### Dynamic Displine

- Synchronous sequential circuits inputs must be stable during aperture (setup and hold) time around clock edge
- Specifically inputs must be stable
  -- at least t(setup) before the clockedge
  -- at least until t(hold) after the clockedge
- The delay between registers has a minimium and maxium delay dependent on the delays of the circuit elements

##### Setup time constraing

- Depends on the _Maximum_ delay from register R1 through combinational logic to R2
- The input to register R2 must be stable at least t(setup) before clock edge
- T(c) >= Tpcq + Tpd + Tsetup
- Tpd <= Tc - (Tpcq + Tsetup)
- (Tpcq + Tsetup) is called a sequencing overhead

== R1 --> Q1 --> CL --> D2 --> R2

#### Propagation Delay

- Output pernimately changed
- time after clock edge that the output Q is guaranteed to be stable ( time to stop changing )

#### Setup Time

- Time before clock edge data must be stable
- For us to keep subject still

#### Hold Time

- GIVEN in Data sheet
- Time after clock edge must be stable
- For read so that input isnt blurry

#### Hold time constraint

- Shortest Delay from R1 through combinational Circuit to R2
- T(hold) < T(ccq) + T(cd)
- T(cd) > T(hold) - T(ccq)
- Think about the propogational delay
- make sure that nothing change between the hold time and the clock edge

Ex Timing Analysis

- T(ccq) = 30ps
- T(pcq) = 50ps
- T(setup) = 60ps
- T(hold) = 70ps
- T(pd)/per gate = 35ps
- T(cd)/per gate = 25ps

#### Instructions (Computer)

- 1 instruction subleq
- How do we go from assembly to machine?
- 4 states for Operations ADD, AND, NOT, BN2
- 4 registers
- a = b + c --> Add R0, R1, R2 (Assembly Language) --> Convert to Machine Language (assembler) --> Opcode (Machine code stored in RAM) = 0x06
- Instruction Memory 256 bytes (instructions fit in a 1 WORD size in this case 8 bits )
- has to bring the ALU to connect with the register.. The Instruction Memory takes the first few bits from the Op Code in memory to go to the multiplexoer in the ALU
- Program Counter the number on the address port = to specific register.
- Fetch the instruction -- Decode -- Execute the instruction --> Writeback
- Branch if not zero instruction
- The Program counter (PC) will start at 0 then add 1.
- The bit width of the PC will be have to hold the IM States
-
- CISC (Complicated Instruction Set Computer) - Decoding Costly -
- RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)

#### Clock Skew

- The clock doesnt arrive at all registers at the same time
- Skew Difference between 2 clock edges
- perform worst case analysis to guarantee dynamic discipline is not violated for any register - many registers in a system
- T(clock) >= Tccq + Tcd + Tsetup + tskew

#### Apature Time

- GIVEN in Data sheet
- Time around clock edge data must be stable
- Setup Time + Hold Time = Apeture Time

Exercise 3.9 The toggle (T) flip-flop has one input, CLK, and one output, Q. On
each rising edge of CLK, Q toggles to the complement of its previous value. Draw
a schematic for a T flip-flop using a D flip-flop and an inverter.
Okay, let's design a T flip-flop using a D flip-flop and an inverter.

Understanding the Goal:

T Flip-Flop Behavior: The output Q toggles (flips to its opposite state) on each rising edge of the clock (CLK) input. If Q is 0, it becomes 1; if Q is 1, it becomes 0.
D Flip-Flop Behavior: The output Q takes the value of the D input on the rising edge of the clock (CLK).
Connecting the Behaviors:

To make the D flip-flop toggle its output Q, we need to ensure that the D input always holds the complement of the current Q output just before the clock edge arrives.

The Design:

Take a standard edge-triggered D flip-flop. It has inputs D and CLK, and an output Q (and often Q', the complement, though we only strictly need Q for this).
Take an inverter (NOT gate).
Connect the Q output of the D flip-flop to the input of the inverter.
Connect the output of the inverter back to the D input of the D flip-flop.
The external CLK input for the T flip-flop connects directly to the CLK input of the D flip-flop.
The Q output of the D flip-flop serves as the Q output of the T flip-flop.
Schematic Description:

      +-----------+         +-------+

CLK --| CLK | | |
| Q O-|---------| Input |---O Inverter Output
| D FF | | | |
D O--| D | | +-------+
| +-----------+ |
| |
+-------------------+ (Feedback Loop)

Explanation of Operation:

Assume Q is initially 0: The inverter receives 0 at its input, so its output is 1. This 1 is fed to the D input of the flip-flop. On the next rising CLK edge, the D flip-flop captures the value 1, so Q becomes 1.
Assume Q is currently 1: The inverter receives 1 at its input, so its output is 0. This 0 is fed to the D input of the flip-flop. On the next rising CLK edge, the D flip-flop captures the value 0, so Q becomes 0.
In both cases, the Q output toggles its state on the rising edge of the clock, fulfilling the requirement of a T flip-flop.

Exercise 3.19 You are designing an elevator controller for a building with 25
floors. The controller has two inputs: UP and DOWN. It produces an output
indicating the floor that the elevator is on. There is no floor 13. What is the
minimum number of bits of state in the controller?
Okay, let's figure out the minimum number of bits needed for the elevator controller's state.

Identify the State: The core state the controller needs to track is the current floor the elevator is on.
Determine the Number of Possible States:
The building has floors numbered 1 through 25.
Floor 13 does not exist.
So, the possible floors are 1, 2, ..., 11, 12, 14, 15, ..., 24, 25.
The total number of possible floor locations (states) is 25 - 1 = 24.
Calculate the Minimum Bits: We need to find the smallest integer 'n' such that 2^n is greater than or equal to the number of states.
We need to represent 24 distinct states.
2^4 = 16 (This is not enough)
2^5 = 32 (This is sufficient)
Therefore, the minimum number of bits required to represent the 24 possible floor states is 5 bits.

The UP and DOWN inputs are used to change the state, but the number of bits is determined by the number of unique states (floor locations) that need to be represented.

Exercise 3.22 Describe in words what the state machine in Figure 3.69 does. Using
binary state encodings, complete a state transition table and output table for the
FSM. Write Boolean equations for the next state and output and sketch a
schematic of the FSM.
Okay, let's analyze the Finite State Machine (FSM) shown in Figure 3.69.

1. Description of FSM Behavior

This is a 3-state Moore machine (output Q depends only on the current state) with two inputs, A and B, and one output, Q. It also has an asynchronous Reset.

Reset: When Reset is asserted, the machine immediately goes to state S0, where the output Q is 0.
State S0 (Q=0): The machine stays in S0 as long as input A is 0. If input A becomes 1, it transitions to state S1 on the next clock edge.
State S1 (Q=0): From S1, if input B is 0, the machine transitions back to S0 on the next clock edge. If input B is 1, it transitions to state S2.
State S2 (Q=1): This is the only state where the output Q is 1. The machine stays in S2 as long as input A is 1. If input A becomes 0, it transitions back to S0 on the next clock edge.
In summary: The FSM outputs Q=1 when it detects the input sequence A=1 followed by B=1. It continues to output 1 as long as A remains 1. If A goes to 0 (while in S2) or if B is 0 when transitioning from S1, the machine returns to the initial state S0 (Q=0).

2. Binary State Encoding and Tables

We have 3 states, so we need a minimum of ceil(log₂(3)) = 2 state bits. Let's call them S₁ (MSB) and S₀ (LSB).

S0: 00
S1: 01
S2: 10
Now, let's create the state transition and output tables. S₁ and S₀ represent the current state bits, while S₁' and S₀' represent the next state bits. Q is the output.

State Transition and Output Table:

| Current State | S₁  | S₀  | A   | B   | S₁' | S₀' | Next State | Q   |
| :------------ | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--------- | :-- |
| S0            | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | S0         | 0   |
| S0            | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | S0         | 0   |
| S0            | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   | S1         | 0   |
| S0            | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   | S1         | 0   |
| S1            | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | S0         | 0   |
| S1            | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | S2         | 0   |
| S1            | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | S0         | 0   |
| S1            | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 0   | S2         | 0   |
| S2            | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | S0         | 1   |
| S2            | 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | S0         | 1   |
| S2            | 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   | S2         | 1   |
| S2            | 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 0   | S2         | 1   |

(Note: Rows can be slightly condensed using "don't cares" based on the diagram, but this full table is explicit)

3. Boolean Equations

From the table, we derive the equations for the next state bits (S₁', S₀') and the output (Q) based on the current state bits (S₁, S₀) and inputs (A, B).

Output Q (Moore): Q depends only on the current state. Q=1 only when the state is S2 (10).
Q = S₁ AND (NOT S₀)
(Simplified based on encoding: Q is 1 only when S₁ is 1)
Q = S₁

Next State S₁' : Look for rows where S₁' = 1.

Row 6: (NOT S₁) AND S₀ AND (NOT A) AND B
Row 8: (NOT S₁) AND S₀ AND A AND B
Row 11: S₁ AND (NOT S₀) AND A AND (NOT B)
Row 12: S₁ AND (NOT S₀) AND A AND B Combining using Karnaugh map or Boolean algebra: S₁' = ( (NOT S₁) AND S₀ AND B ) OR ( S₁ AND (NOT S₀) AND A ) (Check: If current is S1(01), S₁'= B. If current is S2(10), S₁' = A. If current is S0(00), S₁'=0) S₁' = (S₀ AND B) OR (S₁ AND A)
Next State S₀' : Look for rows where S₀' = 1.

Row 3: (NOT S₁) AND (NOT S₀) AND A AND (NOT B)
Row 4: (NOT S₁) AND (NOT S₀) AND A AND B Combining: S₀' = (NOT S₁) AND (NOT S₀) AND A S₀' = (NOT S₁) AND (NOT S₀) AND A
Summary of Equations:

Q = S₁
S₁' = (S₀ AND B) OR (S₁ AND A)
S₀' = (NOT S₁) AND (NOT S₀) AND A 4. Schematic Sketch

The FSM requires:

Two D flip-flops (for state bits S₁ and S₀).
Combinational logic (AND, OR, NOT gates) to calculate S₁', S₀', and Q.
Inputs: A, B, Clock (CLK), Reset.
Output: Q.

Explanation of Schematic:

Flip-Flops: Two D flip-flops store the state bits S₁ and S₀. They share a common Clock and asynchronous Reset input. The Reset should force the Q outputs (S₁ and S₀) to 0 (state S0).
Next State Logic (S₁'): An AND gate computes (S₀ AND B). Another AND gate computes (S₁ AND A). An OR gate combines these two results. The output of the OR gate is connected to the D input (D₁) of the S₁ flip-flop.
Next State Logic (S₀'): Inverters compute (NOT S₁) and (NOT S₀). A 3-input AND gate combines (NOT S₁), (NOT S₀), and A. Its output connects to the D input (D₀) of the S₀ flip-flop.
Output Logic (Q): Since Q = S₁, the Q output of the S₁ flip-flop is connected directly to the final output Q.
Connections: The current state outputs (Q from FF1 and FF0, representing S₁ and S₀) are fed back into the combinational logic block. External inputs A and B are also fed into the logic.

Exercise 3.25 Alyssa P. Hacker’s snail from Section 3.4.3 has a daughter with a
Mealy machine FSM brain. The daughter snail smiles whenever she slides over the
pattern 1101 or the pattern 1110. Sketch the state transition diagram for this
happy snail using as few states as possible. Choose state encodings and write a
combined state transition and output table using your encodings. Write the next
state and output equations and sketch your FSM schematic.
Okay, let's design the Mealy FSM brain for the happy daughter snail.

1. Understanding the Goal

Machine Type: Mealy FSM (output depends on current state AND current input).
Input: A single bit stream (let's call the input X).
Output: Smile (let's call it Y). Y=1 when a target pattern is completed, Y=0 otherwise.
Target Patterns: 1101 and 1110.
Goal: Detect these patterns using the minimum number of states. 2. State Transition Diagram Design (Minimizing States)

We need states to remember the relevant history of the input stream. Let's define states based on the longest recognized suffix of a target pattern.

S0: Initial state, or no relevant suffix matched.
S1: The sequence ends in '1' (but not '11').
S2: The sequence ends in '11'.
S3: The sequence ends in '110'. (Potential prefix for 1101)
S4: The sequence ends in '111'. (Potential prefix for 1110)
Now, let's define the transitions (Input X / Output Y):

From S0:
X=0: Not part of any pattern start. Stay in S0. Output Y=0. (S0 -- 0/0 --> S0)
X=1: Potential start of a pattern. Go to S1. Output Y=0. (S0 -- 1/0 --> S1)
From S1 (Ends in '1'):
X=0: Sequence is "10". Not a prefix. Reset to S0. Output Y=0. (S1 -- 0/0 --> S0)
X=1: Sequence is "11". Go to S2. Output Y=0. (S1 -- 1/0 --> S2)
From S2 (Ends in '11'):
X=0: Sequence is "110". Go to S3. Output Y=0. (S2 -- 0/0 --> S3)
X=1: Sequence is "111". Go to S4. Output Y=0. (S2 -- 1/0 --> S4)
From S3 (Ends in '110'):
X=0: Sequence is "1100". The '0' is not useful. Reset to S0. Output Y=0. (S3 -- 0/0 --> S0)
X=1: Sequence is "1101". Pattern detected! Output Y=1. The last '1' starts a new potential pattern. Go to S1. (S3 -- 1/1 --> S1)
From S4 (Ends in '111'):
X=0: Sequence is "1110". Pattern detected! Output Y=1. The last '0' is not useful. Reset to S0. (S4 -- 0/1 --> S0)
X=1: Sequence is "1111". No pattern detected (Y=0). The last "11" is a prefix. Go to S2. (S4 -- 1/0 --> S2)
This uses 5 states (S0, S1, S2, S3, S4), which appears minimal as each state represents a distinct, necessary prefix history.

Sketch of State Transition Diagram:

Code snippet

S3((S3))

    S0 -- 0 / 0 --> S0
    S0 -- 1 / 0 --> S1
    S1 -- 0 / 0 --> S0
    S1 -- 1 / 0 --> S2
    S2 -- 0 / 0 --> S3
    S2 -- 1 / 0 --> S4
    S3 -- 0 / 0 --> S0
    S3 -- 1 / 1 --> S1
    S4 -- 0 / 1 --> S0
    S4 -- 1 / 0 --> S2

    style S3 stroke:#f00,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
    style S4 stroke:#f00,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff

(States S3 and S4 are highlighted just to show they are the ones producing Y=1 outputs)

3. State Encoding

We need ⌈log₂(5)⌉ = 3 state bits. Let the state bits be S₂, S₁, S₀.

S0: 000
S1: 001
S2: 010
S3: 011
S4: 100 4. Combined State Transition and Output Table

Let S₂, S₁, S₀ be the current state bits and S₂', S₁', S₀' be the next state bits. X is the input, Y is the output.

| Current State | S₂  | S₁  | S₀  | Input X | S₂' | S₁' | S₀' | Next State | Output Y |

| S1            |  0  |  0  |  1  | 1       |  0  |  1  |  0  | S2         | 0        |
| S2            |  0  |  1  |  0  | 0       |  0  |  1  |  1  | S3         | 0        |
| S2            |  0  |  1  |  0  | 1       |  1  |  0  |  0  | S4         | 0        |
| S3            |  0  |  1  |  1  | 0       |  0  |  0  |  0  | S0         | 0        |

| S4            |  1  |  0  |  0  | 1       |  0  |  1  |  0  | S2         | 0        |

| Unused        |  1  |  1  |  0  | X       |  0  |  0  |  0  | S0         | 0        | (Default/Don't Care) |
