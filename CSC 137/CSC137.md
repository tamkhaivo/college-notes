## Important - Most Time

1. CPU (DESIGN AND BUILD CPU)

- conventional (positivde to negative)
- Combinations -> Binary States
- All circuits are connected to volts & ground
  -- vcc (voltage) = cdd (drain)
  -- inverter = NOT can be added to the regular circuits to make them NAND, NOR, NXOR
  -- cononical ordering = truth tables
  -- XOR = AB' + A'B

2. RAM
3. GPU
4. Tensor Processing Unit (Specialized Math Chip)

## Data Representation

## Digital Design

### Combinational Design (No Memory States)

1. Capture

- Truth table or equation whichever describes **desired behavior**

2. Convert

- Truth Table instead of equations -- create an equation for each output then SIMPLIFY KMAPS --> Column Simplfiction
- Minimze number of chips - Minimize number of gates - CMOS 4000 - Dual inline packages (DIP 14)

3. Implement

- For each output create a circuit corresponding to the output equations

Output in binary, on 2 outputs y and z, the number of 1s on 3 binary inputs a,b,c

- Adding 3 single binary numbers --> Voting System
- A'B'C + A'C'B + B'C'A + ABC (Midterm) = y
- ABC' + AC'B + BCA' + ABC (Midterm) = z

{ABC} == Term
A, B, C == Factors

==> Max numbers of inverters I need? (len of input)
==> Max Number of AND gates = Count of 1s in output on truth table (Unless shared & No timing issues aka glitches)

#### Example

F = A'BC + AB'C + ABC' + ABC + ABC + ABC
==> BC(A' + A) + AC(B' + B) + AB(C' + C)
==> BC + AC + AB

### KMAPS

Kmap - you are garunteed to have minimum circuit (and or and not gates)

- minimize

Boolean expressions can be minimized by combining terms
AB 00 01 11 10 <-- Greay Code 1 bit change at at time
**\*\***\_\_**\*\***
C 0 | 0 1 0 0
1 | 0 1 1 0

- Every 1 must be circled at least once
- Each Circle span a power of 2
- Each circle must be as large as possible
-

1. Complement - Bar over it
2. Literal - Complement
3. Impl

Kilobyte - 1_000 = 10^3
Megabyte - 1_000_000 = 10^6
Gigabyte = 1_000_000_000 = 10^9
Terrabyte= 1_000_000_000_000 = 10^12
Petabyte = 1_000_000_000_000_000 = 10^15
