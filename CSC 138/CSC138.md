## Gradings

1. Pop Quizzes - 5-10%
2. Quizzes - 30-35%
3. Final Exam - 30-35%
4. Projects/HW - 30-35%

A = 100-84.45
B = 84.44-69.45
C = 69.44-54.45
D = 49.45-55
F = 50-0

## Top Down

- Bottom Approach

1. Physical Layer
   -- What are we using to connect to port --> Bandwidth --> Physical Layer
2. Data
3. Network Layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Application Layer

Internet Protocols
Set of Rules to Communicate (Introductions, Questions, Answers)
Format - Order- Message Sent/Recv

- RTC
-

Programming Interface

- Hooks - Allowing send and recieve to connect

Digital Subscriber Line

- Phone line to connect to internet

WIFI

- Half-duplex w/ broadcast
- TX stronger than RX
- Propagation enviornment via Reflection, obstruction, interface

Driven By Economics and National Policies

Curcuit Switching

- Frequency division multiplexing (FDM)
  -- Optical, Frequencies, Each call allocated its own band
- Time division multiplexing (TDM)
  -- Dividied into slots
  -- NOT Packet SWITCHING
  -- Periodic Slots, wider = more bandiwth

Packet Switching vs Circuit Switching

- 1Gb/s Link
- 100Mbs when active
- Active 10% of the time

1. Circuit Switching

- 10 Users
-

2. Packet Switching

- 35 Users (Prob greater than 10 active users is less than 0.0004)
- Negative Binomial (p = .1, x = 35, r = 10) = 0.00038
- Bursty Data
  -- Sometimes has data to send and sometimes not
  -- Resources Sharing
- Excessive Congestion
  -- Packet Delay

## Internet Structure

- Customer and ISPs have economic agreement
- Multiple ISPs due to competition and cheaper
- IXP - Internet Exchange Points to share ISPs
- Peering Link - Between ISPs
- Regional ISP - Buy link between rural (few people)
- Tier 1 ISPs
  -- AT&T
- Content Provider Network (Google, Facebook)

Packet Delay anbd Loss

- Queue in router buffers wait for transmission
- Packet Loss occues when queue packet fills up
- Loss packet may be retransmitted by previous node, by source system, or not at all
- Packet arriving to full queue

EME Delay

- Propogation Delay from the MOON to Other side of the Earth

Caravan Analogy

- Car = bit
- Caravan = packet
- Toll Booth = 12s/car
- Propogation at 100km/hr
- Transmission Time = 120s
- Propogation Time = 1hr
- All of Caravan = 62 mins

a = acerage packet arrival rate
L = packet length (bits)
R = Link bandwidth

La / R = Traffic Intensity

0 = Average Queing Delay is small
1 = Queuing Delay is Large

> 1 = More work is arriving than can be services
> <75% of bandwidth is optimal

Real Internet and Delay

- Traceroute provides a measure of delay from end to end
