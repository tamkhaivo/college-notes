## Gradings

1. Pop Quizzes - 5-10%
2. Quizzes - 30-35%
3. Final Exam - 30-35%
4. Projects/HW - 30-35%

A = 100-84.45
B = 84.44-69.45
C = 69.44-54.45
D = 49.45-55
F = 50-0

## Top Down

- Bottom Approach

1. Physical Layer
   -- What are we using to connect to port --> Bandwidth --> Physical Layer
2. Data
3. Network Layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Application Layer

Internet Protocols
Set of Rules to Communicate (Introductions, Questions, Answers)
Format - Order- Message Sent/Recv

- RTC
-

Programming Interface

- Hooks - Allowing send and recieve to connect

Digital Subscriber Line

- Phone line to connect to internet

WIFI

- Half-duplex w/ broadcast
- TX stronger than RX
- Propagation enviornment via Reflection, obstruction, interface

Driven By Economics and National Policies

Curcuit Switching

- Frequency division multiplexing (FDM)
  -- Optical, Frequencies, Each call allocated its own band
- Time division multiplexing (TDM)
  -- Dividied into slots
  -- NOT Packet SWITCHING
  -- Periodic Slots, wider = more bandiwth

Packet Switching vs Circuit Switching

- 1Gb/s Link
- 100Mbs when active
- Active 10% of the time

1. Circuit Switching

- 10 Users
-

2. Packet Switching

- 35 Users (Prob greater than 10 active users is less than 0.0004)
- Negative Binomial (p = .1, x = 35, r = 10) = 0.00038
- Bursty Data
  -- Sometimes has data to send and sometimes not
  -- Resources Sharing
- Excessive Congestion
  -- Packet Delay

## Internet Structure

- Customer and ISPs have economic agreement
- Multiple ISPs due to competition and cheaper
- IXP - Internet Exchange Points to share ISPs
- Peering Link - Between ISPs
- Regional ISP - Buy link between rural (few people)
- Tier 1 ISPs
  -- AT&T
- Content Provider Network (Google, Facebook)

Packet Delay anbd Loss

- Queue in router buffers wait for transmission
- Packet Loss occues when queue packet fills up
- Loss packet may be retransmitted by previous node, by source system, or not at all
- Packet arriving to full queue

EME Delay

- Propogation Delay from the MOON to Other side of the Earth

Caravan Analogy

- Car = bit
- Caravan = packet
- Toll Booth = 12s/car
- Propogation at 100km/hr
- Transmission Time = 120s
- Propogation Time = 1hr
- All of Caravan = 62 mins

a = acerage packet arrival rate
L = packet length (bits)
R = Link bandwidth

La / R = Traffic Intensity

0 = Average Queing Delay is small
1 = Queuing Delay is Large

> 1 = More work is arriving than can be services
> <75% of bandwidth is optimal

Real Internet and Delay

- Traceroute provides a measure of delay from end to end

## Network Security

- Internet not origionally designed with much security
  -- Original vision: a group of mutually trusting users attached to a trasnsport netowkr
  -- Security considerations in all layers

### SSH vs Telnet

- Telnet is used for embedded systems (Trusting - Plaintext w/ Username and Passwords)
- SSH is more computation intensive
- Design architecture immune to attack

### Bad Guys

1. Packet Sniffing via broadcast media or promiscuous network interface reads
2. IP Spoofing (Fake Identity) - Injection of false sources address
3. DDOS - Resources bandwidth unavailable with bogus traffic

### Lines of Defences

1. Authentication - Proving you are who you say you are

- Cellular networks provides harware identity via SIM card

2. Confidentiality via Encryption
3. Integrity Checks via Digital Signatures prevent/detects tampering
4. Access Restrictions - Password protected VPNs
5. Security through Obscurity - Better than nothing
6. Firewall - Middleboxes in access and core networks
   -- detects DDOS
   -- off-by-default - restricting access

## Protocols

Regulate the communication between

1. Hosts
2. Routes
3. Links
4. Applications
5. Protocols
6. Hardware

Ticket (Purchase) --- Ticket (Complain)
Baggage (Check) --- Baggage (Claim)
Gates (Load) --- Gates Unload
Runaway Takeoff --- Runaway Landing
Airline Routing --- Airline Routing

### Why Layering

- Explicit Structure which allows identification, relationship of systms, layer reference model
- modularized change

#### Layers

1. Application (HTTP, IMAP, SMTP, DNS) - Message
2. Transport (TCP, UDP) - Segment
3. Network (IP, ARP, ICMP) - Datagram
4. Data Link (MAC, LLC, Ethernet, PPP, 802.11) - Frame
5. Physical (Bits on the line)

ISO/OSI Reference Model

1. Application
2. Presentation (Allows Applications to interpret meaning of data, encryption, compression, machine-sepecific conversion) -- Pushed into Application Layer
3. Session (Syncronization, checkpointing, recovery of data) --> down into transport layer
4. Transport
5. Network
6. Data Link
7. Physical

Cerf and Khanh - Internet Architecture

1. Minimalism, automomy, no internal changes required
2. best-effort service model
3. stateless routing
4. decentralized control

Software defined networking (SDN)
Cloud Services

Port 59 - Homework

SimplePingClient.java - 21 Lines of Code
TimedPingClient.java - 41 Lines of Code

java h.java

### IP Fragmentation

1500 bytes Ethernet
4500 bytes DFFI

ip-addresss 32 bit identifier - IPV4
Minimum number - 2 one for comcast one for you
NAT reduces to 1 address

#### Global Addresses

- Globally Unique
- Hierarchical
- 4 billion ip half are A type, 1/4 b type, 1/8 type
- 2 Addresses are Reserved
  -- 0.0.0.0 (Broadcast)
  -- 255.255.255.255 (Router)

| Format | aa  | Network | Host | # IP Networks | # of Hosts |
| ------ | --- | ------- | ---- | ------------- | ---------- |
| A Type | 1   | 7       | 24   | 128           | 16_777_216 |
| B Type | 2   | 14      | 16   | 16_384        | 65_536     |
| C Type | 3   | 21      | 8    | 2_097_152     | 256        |
